Sniffnet is a <b>completely free, open-source software</b> which needs your support to be maintained on a regular basis.
<br/><br/>
<hr/>
If you appreciate Sniffnet and find it useful, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/GyulyVGC?preview=true">please consider donating</a>: this is the only way for me to keep working on this project,
constantly improving and expanding it:
<ul>
  <li>if you are an <b>individual</b>, keep in mind that every single bit can make a huge difference for me</li>
  <li>if you are an <b>enterprise</b>, I can offer my technical support and I'm open to consulting services</li>
</ul>
