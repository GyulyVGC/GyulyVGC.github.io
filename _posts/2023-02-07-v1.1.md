Sniffnet **version 1.1** is out!<br>

</div>
One of the most exciting features of this release is the introduction of **IP geolocation**:
it refers to the remote IP address of the connection, and it's performed using an **MMDB file**.<br>
The MMDB (MaxMind database) format is optimized to perform lookups on data indexed by IP network ranges quickly and efficiently:
this format potentially allows Sniffnet to execute different hundreds of IP lookups in a matter of a few milliseconds.

Another significant new feature is the possibility to set **custom notifications** to inform the user when defined network events occur.

</div>


Finally, a _**Settings**_ popup page was added to configure the state of the application (persistently stored in a configuration file).<br>
This page allows users to set their **notification preferences**, change the **color palette**, and the **interface language**.
