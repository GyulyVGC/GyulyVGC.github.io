After a ton of work and a lot of fun, I'm overjoyed to announce that Sniffnet finally has a **Graphical User Interface**!<br><br>
Sniffnet is a network analyser (packet sniffer) developed with the aim to let people have a glance into their network traffic **without pain, in a simple and clear way**: to this purpose, the last release of the application introduces a whole friendly GUI (made with <a target="_blank" href="https://iced.rs">iced</a>).

<div align="center">
    <img  width="100%" title="Sniffnet GUI" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/v1.0.0/cover.png' | relative_url }}"/><br><br>
</div>

Functionalities:
- select a **network adapter** to inspect
- select **filters** to apply (currently available: IP version, transport protocol and application protocol)
- view **charts** about traffic intensity in real-time (bytes and packets per second, incoming and outgoing)
- view overall **statistics** about the filtered traffic
- view most relevant **connections** (most recent, most packets, most bytes)
- view **textual report** with detailed information on the exchanged packets

In order to reach out to as many people as possible, I also created installers for Windows, macOS and Linux, to make it easier to install Sniffnet for those that still don't have Rust installed.
