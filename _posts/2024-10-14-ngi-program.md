It's such a joy for me to announce that Sniffnet was <a target="_blank" href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2024/20241014-announcing-CommonsFund-call.html">
elected to receive funding from NLnet</a>.<br><br>
The **NLnet Foundation** supports organizations and people who contribute to an open internet for all.<br>
It funds projects that help fix the internet through open hardware, open software, open standards, open science and open data.

Their support is made possible by the **NGI Zero Commons Fund**, whose aim is to help deliver,
mature and scale new internet commons across the whole technology spectrum,
from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications.

The NGI Zero Commons Fund exists thanks to financial support from the European Commission's <a target="_blank" href="https://ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> programme,
an initiative to **re-imagine and re-engineer the Internet for the third millennium and beyond**, shaping a value-centric, human, and inclusive society for all.

This is an incredible opportunity for me to further improve and expand the project,
and it's a strong signal that awesome organizations exist out there to facilitate open source advancement!
