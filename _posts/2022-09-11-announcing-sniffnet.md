I'm thrilled to announce **Sniffnet**!<br>
This framework consists of a **network packet sniffer/filter** generating a graphical and a textual report,
providing statistics about the filtered traffic and a list of source and destination addresses and ports,
with their exchanged packets and the respective carried protocols.

Any feedback or suggestion about new features or improvement to the existing functions is highly appreciated!

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request, thanks in advance for your support!
