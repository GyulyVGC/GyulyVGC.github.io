One year ago, I would have never imagined Sniffnet could reach such a huge amount of interest and support from the community.<br><br>
Fun fact: one year ago, Sniffnet didn't even exist - this project is just 9 and a half months old today 🍼

After having hit several important milestones, such as being featured in GitHub overall trending page, being selected for the GitHub Accelerator Program, being featured in Hacker News front page, and reaching 7k GitHub stars, I decided it was finally time for this project to have an **official website**: <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">sniffnet.net</a>

The website is currently undergoing maintenance and I'm open to tips on what to add or change, so your feedback is appreciated and it will be taken into account 🙌 

Seeing Sniffnet growing so fast make me wonder what it can accomplish in the future.<br>
To this purpose, I also want to share that **Sniffnet is open to corporate partnerships**: _if you are a company or you know a company that could be interested in supporting Sniffnet growth, please reach out to me to start building together a future for the project_ 💡
