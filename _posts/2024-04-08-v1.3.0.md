After some months without new major releases, I'm happy to announce that **Sniffnet v1.3.0** is finally out! ðŸŽ‰<br><br>
This release introduces several long requested features, such as **export of PCAP files**,
support for **ICMP**, detection of more **upper layer services**,
and other functionalities to improve the overall user experience,
such as the new **thumbnail mode** and the possibility to totally **customize** the application color palette.<br>
Iâ€™ve also dedicated some efforts to enhance Sniffnet documentation, coming up with a complete <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki">user manual</a> hosted on GitHub Wiki.

Let's see some of the most relevant new features and improvements.

- **Thumbnail mode**: a compact view of the app that can be moved to any corner of the screen, allowing you to keep an eye on your traffic while performing other tasks (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Thumbnail-mode">_read more_</a>)

- **Export** the analysis as a **PCAP file** with a custom path: this is a big step forward in making Sniffnet compatible with most of the existing network monitoring tools (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/PCAP-file-export">_read more_</a>)
- **Totally customize the app's theme** via styles defined in TOML files (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Custom-themes">_read more_</a>)
- Added capability to identify **6000+ upper layer services**, protocols, trojans, and worms
- Support **ICMP** connections and messages
- Upgraded inspect page table: multiple new **search filters**, and additional **sorting options**
- Support for **more link types** in addition to Ethernet, enabling correct monitoring of all the most common network adapters, including typical VPN interfaces
- Support changing sort strategy for network hosts and services in overview page, showing **most recent** items by default
- Users can now provide custom paths for **MMDB files** to allow using the commercial versions of the country and ASN databases

_These are just some of the changes introduced in this release.<br>
