<a href="{{ 'news/github-trending' | relative_url }}">Some weeks ago</a>, Sniffnet reached the GitHub trending page — I was so proud about it.<br><br>
But I would have never imagined what happened earlier today: **GitHub itself tweeted about the project** and I’m feeling blessed.

<div align="center">
    <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/github/status/1605652851245649931">
        <img  width="70%" title="GitHub tweet about Sniffnet" alt="GitHub tweet about Sniffnet" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/github-tweet/cover.png' | relative_url }}"/>
    </a>
</div>

I’ve never experienced such a joy for something I’ve built with my hands.<br>
Seeing that people appreciate my open source work is an unexplainable and overwhelming feeling which motivates me a lot.

Open source coding is just amazing.
