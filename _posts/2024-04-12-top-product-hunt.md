A <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases/tag/v1.3.0">new major version</a> of Sniffnet was published just a few days ago,
featuring some really cool functionalities that aim to enrich the **networking capabilities** of the app as well as to improve the overall **user experience**.

Moreover, this release finally comes with a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki">complete user manual</a>
and gives a **new identity** to the app by replacing the old logo with a simpler and more modern-looking one.

In occasion of this remarkable release, Sniffnet was today launched on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>,
a website that showcases daily collections of the **best new tech products**.

It's a huge pleasure for me to see that Sniffnet received appreciation by the public, being **featured among the TOP 5 products of the day**.

Many times we hear about **Rust** as a low-level programming language, but several projects day after day start to show that it can also be used to build successful products that are **closer to the end users**.

I'm honoured that Sniffnet is one of the examples out there showing that **graphical user interfaces** in Rust have a **great potential**.

I'm confident we'll see more and more **ground-breaking, open-source projects** built in Rust in the following years.

_Keep pushing!_ ðŸ™Œ
