Sniffnet has **grown a lot** during the past months, and it’s been a pleasure for me to spend most of my spare time on its development.
I'm not gonna lie: passing hours and hours on this project has become my favorite hobby lately.

I can’t deny that sometimes **it’s been hard** to balance Sniffnet’s development with the daily University routine, made of never-ending lectures, group projects, deliveries, and home study.<br>
I often ended up coding late (I mean _very_ late) at night or skipping meals/lectures, since 24 hours a day never seemed enough.<br>
Seeing Sniffnet getting traction and evolving, improving day after day, motivated me to **keep pushing** despite the obstacles along the way.

**Long story short**: having more time to dedicate to open-source was one of my primary wishes (and needs 😅).

Today, the 12th of April 2023, it’s such a joy for me to announce that **Sniffnet has been selected for the GitHub Accelerator Program** 🎉

The [GitHub Accelerator](https://accelerator.github.com) is a program to pioneer new ways for developers to sustainably work on their **open-source projects full-time**.<br>
20 promising and influential open-source projects [have been elected](https://github.blog/2023-04-12-github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next/), out of more than a thousand total applicants.<br>
The maintainers of such projects will participate in a 10-week program receiving an initial **sponsorship** as well as **mentorship** from open-source leaders and enterprise partners on how to grow software projects and build durable streams of funding.<br>

This means that during the next few months I’ll be able to **work on Sniffnet full-time**, with the aspiration to bring it to the next level.<br>
I’ve lots of ideas for new features and improvements and I’m looking forward to implementing them all 😁

Turning such a huge passion into a full-time job is the best thing I could’ve ever asked for.<br>
I truly wish that this journey will continue even after the 10 weeks of the program, with the hope of working on open-source for my **entire career**.<br>
<br>I believe that more and more programmers deserve to have opportunities like this one, and I hope the Accelerator will pave the way to a **brighter perspective for the open-source community**.<br>
<br>I can’t wait to see what the future has in store, and I feel blessed to have such an amazing occasion.<br>
I’ll do my best to get the most out of this experience 🌟
