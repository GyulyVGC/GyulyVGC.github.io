**Sniffnet merch is finally real** 🎉 <br><br>
A couple weeks ago Sniffnet reached the remarkable milestone of **20k stars** on GitHub — to celebrate we're dropping brand new apparel today!<br>
Such an awesome logo had to be featured on physical goods sooner or later 🕵️‍♂️

You can visit the online store <a target="_blank" href="https://grindhouse.dev/collections/sniffnet">here</a>.

Sniffnet merchandise isn’t only about the **cool apparel**: it’s also a way for you to give something back to the open-source ecosystem, **supporting the development** of your favorite network monitoring tool as an alternative to direct donations.

Let us know if you’d like to see items that aren’t currently available, and we’ll try to make your wishes true!

_The store is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://grindhouse.dev">Grindhouse</a>, a creator outlet for open-source developers, artists, and visionaries who are driven by passion, innovation, and relentless pursuit of their goals._
