I'm excited to share that on June 28, the [GitHub Accelerator Demo Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/github-accelerator-open-source-demo-day-tickets-662569482157) will take place: you can follow the event live on GitHub social channels (YouTube, Twitch, LinkedIn).

I'll be talking about Sniffnet, and I can't wait to present this project to the world!

This is also an occasion for you all to know more about what it means to build a career in the open-source ecosystem.

In the hope the event is of your interest, wish me good luck ü§û üçÄ
