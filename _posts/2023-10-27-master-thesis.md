The last 18 months have been crazy:
- a **university course** made me discover the Rust programming language
- I started a Rust **project**, today known as Sniffnet, that rapidly got more than 10k stars on GitHub
- I had the luck of <a href="{{ 'news/github-accelerator' | relative_url }}">being part of the first GitHub Accelerator cohort</a>
- last month I started working as a **remote Rust developer**
- two days ago I defended a **Master's thesis** about Sniffnet

If I had to choose one word to describe my past year of life, that word would be: "**_Rust_**".

It's unbelievable how sometimes things happen this fast: _there are elements that enter your life almost by chance and end up changing it forever_.

It's a pleasure for me to share the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/resources/thesis.pdf">complete version of the thesis</a> with you all, hoping that it will serve to other as a learning example about how to apply Rust in a project from the beginning to production.
