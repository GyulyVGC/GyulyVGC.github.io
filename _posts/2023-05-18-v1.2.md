Today it’s a pleasure for me to announce **version 1.2**: this is one of the biggest Sniffnet updates so far!<br>
<div align="center">

The main focus of this release is to provide a new perspective on network traffic analysis, shifting from an IP-address-based approach to a **host-based** one:
**host names** and **network providers** are now available for a quicker and more meaningful traffic interpretation.<br>
In particular, **rDNS** (reverse DNS) lookups are added to find out network host names,
and **ASN** (Autonomous System name and number) lookups are introduced to find out the entity managing a given IP address.

What if you still want to see the involved **IP addresses**?<br>
No worries — a new page has been introduced to report the **full list of connections**,
which can now be filtered and sorted according to various parameters.

</div>

Moreover, each connection can be now further inspected with a simple click, 
showing new details such as **MAC addresses** and **fully qualified domain names**.

Sniffnet v1.2 also introduces the identification of addresses in the **local network**,
and full support for **broadcast** traffic recognition.

_These are just some of the changes introduced in this release.<br>
