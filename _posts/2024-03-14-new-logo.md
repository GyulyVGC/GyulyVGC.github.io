It's finally time to give Sniffnet a new face! üéâ<br><br>
Following the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/274">community's feedback</a>,
I've decided to update the app logo to better represent the project's values and goals.<br>
The new logo is more **modern**, **clean**, and **visually appealing**, designed to be recognizable and memorable.

<div align="center">
    <img width="35%" title="Old logo" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/new-logo/old.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Old logo"/>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;
    <img width="35%" title="New logo" src="{{ 'assets/img/icon.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="New logo"/>
</div>

Some Reddit users helped me with the initial concept and sketches, providing valuable feedback and suggestions.<br>
I've then worked on the refinement, producing **different versions and variations** to find the best fit.

<div align="center">
    <img width="35%" title="Initial new candidate logo" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/new-logo/sk0.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Initial new candidate logo"/>&nbsp;
    <img width="35%" title="Original sketch" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/new-logo/sk1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Original sketch"/>
    <br><br>
    <img width="35%" title="Original dark variant" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/new-logo/sk2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Original sketch"/>&nbsp;
    <img width="35%" title="Light variant" src="{{ 'assets/img/post/new-logo/sk3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Light variant"/>
</div>

It's the first time I've realized a logo in a semi-professional way...
I had a lot of fun, and I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome üòÅ
