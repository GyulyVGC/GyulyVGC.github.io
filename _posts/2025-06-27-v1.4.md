I'm delighted to announce that **Sniffnet v1.4** is finally available!<br>
This major release brings a bunch of improvements and fixes, making Sniffnet more powerful and reliable than ever before.<br><br>
One of the most exciting new features is the ability to **process network data from PCAP files** in addition to network adapters.

PCAP (Packet Capture) is a standardized file format for storing network traffic data, widely used by many renowned network analysis tools, including _tcpdump_ and _Wireshark_ (the de-facto standard when it comes to network packet analyzers).<br>
Supporting PCAP files import not only makes Sniffnet fully compatible with other network monitoring tools, but also enables to inspect historical data, which is crucial for troubleshooting and network forensics.<br>

In the video below, you can see Sniffnet in action processing a PCAP file of 1.6 GB (2.6 million packets), corresponding to a **whole day of Internet traffic of my personal computer**.<br>

    </video>
</div>

It takes just about 25 seconds to process the file on an 8-years old MacBook Air (1,8 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5).<br>
This corresponds to more than 100k packets per second, making it **2.2 times faster than Wireshark** on the same machine, which takes about 55 seconds to process the file.

Not only Sniffnet is faster, but it also allows to **preview and interact with the data while it's being processed**, as opposed to Wireshark that requires the whole file to be parsed before displaying any information.<br>
This is a notable feature, especially for large files, as it permits you to start examining the traffic immediately, without waiting for the entire file to be read.

_But... how is Sniffnet this fast?_<br>

</a>

Part of the reason is that Sniffnet is based on the Rust programming language (well-known for its efficiency), but this doesn't tell the whole story.<br>
In fact Wireshark is written in C that, despite not being as safe as Rust, is still characterized by top-tier performance, as shown in the table to the right.<br>
Additionally, Sniffnet uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rust-pcap/pcap">_pcap_</a> crate to process data, which is just a Rust binding library to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap">_libpcap_</a> (the same underlying engine used by Wireshark).<br>

What really sets Sniffnet apart is that it takes a **different approach to process network data**:
instead of parsing the full packets' payloads, it focuses on extracting only the most relevant fields from the packets' headers, such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols.<br>
This minimal amount of information is then used to infer other details like countries, domain names, autonomous systems names, upper layer services, and more.<br>
Considering that nowadays more than <a target="_blank" href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview">90% of the web traffic uses TLS</a>, this strategy enables having huge performance gains without losing much relevant information:
if payloads are encrypted, no meaningful data can be discerned from them anyway.<br>

Besides supporting PCAP files, Sniffnet 1.4 introduces several other features, including:
- support for **ARP** protocol
- a **donut chart** reporting overall traffic statistics
- identification and tagging of **unassigned/reserved "bogon" IP addresses**
- new default **themes** based on palettes optimized for Accessibility
- **enhanced notifications** including more details about each event

_These are just some of the most relevant changes introduced in this release.<br>
