I'm super excited to share that after [yesterday's release](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases/tag/v1.2.0), Sniffnet has made it to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) front page!

I take advantage of this moment to also celebrate another milestone: Sniffnet just surpassed Wireshark stars on GitHub!

I know that those are just numbers, but make me really proud and are a small reward for me after all the efforts I'm putting on this project ðŸ’–
