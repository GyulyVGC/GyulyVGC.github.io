I'm super excited to share that after <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases/tag/v1.2.0">yesterday's release</a>, Sniffnet has made it to <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> front page!

I take advantage of this moment to also celebrate another milestone: Sniffnet just surpassed Wireshark stars on GitHub!

I know that those are just numbers, but make me really proud and are a small reward for me after all the efforts I'm putting on this project ðŸ’–
