Just a few weeks ago I was writing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/yftgad/i_am_officially_addicted_to_rust/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">Reddit post</a>
telling the community how I was getting addicted to Rust while working on Sniffnet.<br><br>
Today the project entered the **GitHub overall trending page**, and I'm feeling amazing.<br><br>
Not the money, not the richness.<br>
What makes me truly happy is just the satisfaction of seeing people using a thing I've built personally in hours, just for the fun of doing it.

What a time to be alive.
